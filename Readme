My_Voice_Agent : 
This project is a Livekit AI voice agent that connects to a Livekit room for real-time voice conversations. 
It uses:
1.Whisper for Speech-to-Text (STT)
2.Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for the Large Language Model (LLM)
3.Cartesia AI for Text-to-Speech (TTS)
4.It also includes interruption handling for natural interaction.

To run it:
1.Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
2.Set up API keys (Gemini, Cartesia, Livekit) and your Livekit server URL in a .env file (remember to keep .env out of Git!).
3.Ensure ffmpeg is installed.
4.Start your Livekit server.
5.Run python voice.py and test it using a Livekit client.

This project is a Livekit AI voice agent that connects to a Livekit room for real-time voice conversations. It uses:

Whisper for Speech-to-Text (STT)
Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for the Large Language Model (LLM)
Cartesia AI for Text-to-Speech (TTS)
It also includes interruption handling for natural interaction.

To run it:

Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
Set up API keys (Gemini, Cartesia, Livekit) and your Livekit server URL in a .env file (remember to keep .env out of Git!).
Ensure ffmpeg is installed.
Start your Livekit server.
Run python main.py and test it using a Livekit client.
